As a part of project, you need to implement functionality of calculating salaries for employees in different companies.
Each company have its own salary budget. Every employee has his own hourly rate and work hours. Basic formula for salary
calculation is ratePerHour * workdays * 8
Each company should have ability to pay salaries to its workers. We should take into consideration that total salary
payments canâ€™t be greater than company wage budget. UML diagram listed below.


1) Write classes that implement this diagram.
2) You should have at least 3 types of employees
e.g.
Manager
Developer
Scrum master
Developer may have bonuses that should be add to the basic salary, it should be taken into consideration
during calculation of his wage.
